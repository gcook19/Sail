#SAIL VR

## Open world Pirate.... I mean Privateer game

### Ready to set sail? 

Current version of SAIL allows you explore islands, sail a ship and look for loot, fight skeletons, find lost treasure and climb monolithic cliffs. It's VR so feel free to walk around the deck, fire the cannon and adjust the sails.  You will also find weapons hidden around the map, if you're having a hard time finding them try breaking those crates you see lying around. 

The map keeps expanding and currently there are  4 areas to explore. 

* Shipwreck Cove is a cursed island full of mystery.  A massive abandoned war ship lies broken on the rocks and stories say it holds treasure guarded by the undead. 

* Monolith Cliffs is a great place to test your sailing skills. Formerly a General Pacific Trading Company prison it has huge obstacles and tight spaces that give new sailors an excellent chance to see what their vessel is capable of. You can also climb to the top of the highest peak to see the lowly prisoner that was hung out for his crimes. 

* Isla Fortuna is a small port town where every sailor starts their quest. With it's grand docks and shops it will soon become the center of all things in the Sail economy. 

* Fool's Paradise is a small island for weary travelers. The Island is famous for being the final resting place of Captain Barrett and a few ominous objects.
